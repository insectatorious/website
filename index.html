My project is about energy measurement in wireless networks (details covered in Education below). I have four years of experience covering various aspects of IT services and computer networks, starting from assembling new systems to finding practical solutions for diverse problems that may occur in networks systems, also tackling problems related to Microsoft services and the Cisco platform.</p>
